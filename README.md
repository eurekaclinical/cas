# Eureka! Clinical Central Authentication Service (CAS)
[Georgia Clinical and Translational Science Alliance (Georgia CTSA)](http://www.georgiactsa.org), [Emory University](http://www.emory.edu), Atlanta, GA

## What does it do?
It is a patched [JASIG (now Apereo) CAS](https://www.apereo.org/projects/cas/) server used for authentication by Eureka! Clinical projects. It provides single sign on across all Eureka! Clinical microservices, thus allowing microservices to be composed into a single integrated application. It can provide its own screens for the user to enter credentials, which are checked against a local database provided by [eurekaclinical-user-service](https://github.com/eurekaclinical/eurekaclinical-user-service) or an LDAP server. Alternatively, it can delegate that function to an OAuth or other CAS server.

This project depends on [version 3.6.0](https://github.com/apereo/cas/releases/tag/v3.6.0) of CAS server, which implements support for versions 1 and 2 of the [CAS protocol](https://apereo.github.io/cas/5.0.x/protocol/CAS-Protocol.html).

This project does not provide user authorization. Eureka! Clinical microservices are responsible for providing their own authorization.

## Version 3.0
The version 3.0 series has integrated password resets and password changes into this project (they previously were in [Eureka! Clinical Analytics](https://github.com/eurekaclinical/eureka)).

## Version 2.0
Turned on the REST API access.

## Version 1.0.2
Initial version supported version 1 of Eureka! Clinical Analytics.

## Build requirements
* [Oracle Java JDK 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/index.html)
* [Maven 3.2.5 or greater](https://maven.apache.org)

## Runtime requirements
* [Oracle Java JRE 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/index.html)
* [Tomcat 7](https://tomcat.apache.org)
* Also running [eurekaclinical-user-service](https://github.com/eurekaclinical/eurekaclinical-user-service) in order to use local authentication

## Building it
The project uses the maven build tool. Typically, you build it by invoking `mvn clean install` at the command line. For simple file changes, not additions or deletions, you can usually use `mvn install`. See https://github.com/eurekaclinical/dev-wiki/wiki/Building-Eureka!-Clinical-projects for more details.

## Installation
### Configuration
Eureka! Clinical CAS is configured via a properties file located at `/etc/ec-cas-server/cas.properties`. In addition to the properties described in the [JASIG CAS documentation](https://wiki.jasig.org/display/casum/configuring), it supports the following properties:
* `eureka.authHandlers`: comma-separated list of handlers for checking credentials entered on the built-in login screen, which may be `jdbc` (check with eurekaclinical-user-service) or `ldap` (check with a specified LDAP directory); default is `jdbc`.
* `eureka.ldap.uid.attribute`: for specifying the UID attribute for an LDAP directory; default is `cn`.
* `eureka.ldap.email.attribute1`: for specifying the email attribute for an LDAP directory; default is `mail`.
* `eureka.ldap.firstName.attribute1`: for specifying the first name attribute for an LDAP directory; default is `firstName`.
* `eureka.ldap.lastName.attribute1`: for specifying the last name attribute for an LDAP directory; default is `lastName`.
* `eureka.ldap.title.attribute1`: for specifying the title attribute for an LDAP directory; default is `title`.
* `eureka.ldap.department.attribute1`: for specifying the department attribute for an LDAP directory; default is `ou`.
* `eureka.ldap.organization.attribute1`: for specifying the organization attribute for an LDAP directory; default is `o`.

A typical `cas.properties` file looks like the following:
```
server.name=https://hostname.running.cas
server.prefix=${server.name}/cas-server
host.name=hostname.running.cas
eureka.authHandlers=jdbc

# Whitelist the services that may access this CAS server.
cas.services.filter=https://(hostname1\\.edu|hostname2\\.edu|localhost).*
```

A Tomcat restart is required to detect any changes to the configuration file.

### WAR installation
1) Stop Tomcat.
2) Remove any old copies of the unpacked war from Tomcat's webapps directory.
3) Copy the warfile into the Tomcat webapps directory, renaming it to remove the version. For example, rename `cas-server-1.0.war` to `cas-server.war`.
4) Start Tomcat.
